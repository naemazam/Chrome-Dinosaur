## Real History

“The idea of “an endless runner” as an easter egg within the “you-are-offline” page was born in early 2014,” says Sebastien Gabriel from the Chrome design team, who co-created the game. “It’s a play on going back to the “prehistoric age” when you had no Wi‑Fi,” he says. “There’s nothing fun about getting kicked offline—unless you have a friendly T-Rex to keep you company, that is,” adds Chrome UX engineer Edward Jung, on why the Dino game was created.

The gameplay was deliberately kept simple. “The only restriction we placed on ourselves was to keep the motion rigid, reminiscent of vintage video games. We settled on the basics of any good runner game: run, duck and jump,” says the Google team. The gameplay is simple too — you only need a couple of keys to play the game, and there are no levels or complex storylines to navigate.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game is most popular in countries with spotty data connections. “Most users come from markets with unreliable or expensive mobile data, like India, Brazil, Mexico, or Indonesia,” says Google. But at times, the game has been too successful for its own good — Google had to give system administrators the ability to turn it off. “It also got to the point where we had to give enterprise admins a way to disable the game because school kids—and even adults who were supposed to be working—really got into it,” says Jung.

And even with 270 million players, no one has ever beaten the game. It’s not likely to happen anytime soon either. “We built it to max out at approximately 17 million years, the same amount of time that the T-rex was alive on Earth… but we feel like your spacebar may not be the same afterwards,” says Google.
